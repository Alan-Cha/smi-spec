#Service Mesh Hub by Solo.io#

The Service Mesh Hub is a mesh agnostic dashboard that implements the SMI specification for users to install and operate meshes. A read only version of the Service Mesh Hub can be found on https://servicemeshhub.io

Service Mesh Hub does
* Built-in installers for different meshes
* Automatically discovers existing meshes, their configurations, running services / extensions and registers them to the Hub to manage
* Install and manage meshes and mesh extensions  
* Extensions tab has ecosystem tools for service mesh environments. Users can also build their own extenstions
* Demos Tab has demo apps for trying out mesh use cases

##Instructions to install Service Mesh Hub##
Install Service Mesh Hub on your kubernetes cluster by running the following command:
```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/service-mesh-hub/master/install/service-mesh-hub.yaml
```

This will install the hub into the `sm-marketplace` namespace. Once the pods are running, you can open the hub by port forwarding:
```
$ kubectl port-forward -n sm-marketplace deploy/smm-apiserver 8080
```

Then navigate your browser to: 
```localhost:8080```


##Contribute Service Mesh Extensions to the Hub##

Contributions to the Service Mesh Hub come in the form of extension specs. The structure of the v1 Gloo extension is below

gloo
├── description.md
├── overlays
│   ├── supergloo
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   │   └── mesh-ingress.yaml
│   └── vanilla
│       ├── custom-resources.yaml
│       └── kustomization.yaml
├── spec.yaml
└── test
    ├── gloo_suite_test.go
    └── gloo_test.go

Extensions have four main sections
1. description.md * the long description of an extension, rendered on the extension’s install page 
1. overlays * kustomization style yaml which can be applied to an extension manifest after it has been rendered 
1. spec.yaml * the main application spec for a given extension 
1. test * unit tests to check the correctness of a given application spec.
